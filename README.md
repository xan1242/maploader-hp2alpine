# NFS Map Loader - Alpine map from Hot Pursuit 2

This is a simple, one-off conversion of Alpine from the PC version of NFS Hot Pursuit 2 to Zolika's Map Loader.

This was tested in NFSMW, but should also work in other games that use Map Loader.

You can find the map loader on Zolika's page for each supported NFS game [here](https://zolika1351.pages.dev)

This is by no means a finished product, I'm providing this as-is without any support and/or warranty.

It is mostly a proof of concept and not meant to be used as a high quality mod.

It looks the way it looks because the models contain no UV maps. The tool that they were converted with (otools) did not provide the info, hence all textures are basically single colors from the original texture.

The collision is also very janky, so beware.

## Installation

1. Install Zolika's map loader

2. Extract the release archive to the root of the game directory

3. Exit the Rosewood (college) safehouse to get the correct starting position
